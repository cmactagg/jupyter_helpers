# jupyter_helpers

contains some helpers for Jupyter/IPython.

cell_minimize.js - reduces the height of a cell to just a few lines when the 's' key is pressed

export_import_cell_to_text_file.js - exports the text from a cell to a text file (within the notebook directory), the text can then be edited in your favorite text editor.  Then import the text back into the cell within Jupyter.  At the top of the cell place #<cell name> and this will name your text file .<cell name>.py.  Most of this code was found elsewhere (sorry I forget where) and modified.


These files are a work in progress.
